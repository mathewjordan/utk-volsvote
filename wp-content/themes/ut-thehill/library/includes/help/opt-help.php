<p>This WordPress theme is based upon the <a href="https://brand.utk.edu/websites/">UT web templates for university websites</a>. The web templates and this WordPress theme share a strong and easily identifiable visual consistency. While individual units and departments should&#8212;and will&#8212;have their own content, we are all a part of something much larger. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with <a href="https://brand.utk.edu/websites/visual-requirements/">the required elements</a> of UT websites.</p>
